# Diffusion .NET Client Examples

This directory contains examples showing the use of the Diffusion .NET Client Library.

The `getting-started` directory contains a simple publishing and
subscribing client. The `examples` directory contains more in-depth
examples that can be run via the `Runner.csproj` project.

## Client libraries

In order for all examples to work you have to pull in
`Diffusion.Client` via NuGet: `dotnet add package Diffusion.Client`.

You can also download the client library from the following locations:

*   Download from [https://www.pushtechnology.com/developers/cloud/latest/#dotnet-sdk](https://www.pushtechnology.com/developers/cloud/latest/#dotnet-sdk)

*   The client library is also available in the `clients` directory of the Diffusion server installation.
