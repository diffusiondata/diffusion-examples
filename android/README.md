# Android examples for the Diffusion APIs

This directory contains examples showing the use of the Android API
for Diffusion and Diffusion Cloud.

The Java API examples are also relevant to Android. The Diffusion Java and
Android APIs are the same, except for a very few changes to
accommodate Android. For example, the Android time series
range query API does not use the `java.time` classes.


## Client library


You can download the Android client library from the following location:

*   [http://download.pushtechnology.com/cloud/latest/sdks.html](http://download.pushtechnology.com/cloud/latest/sdks.html#android)

The client library is also available in the `clients` directory of the Diffusion installation.
