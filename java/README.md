# Java examples for the Diffusion APIs

This directory contains examples showing the use of the Java API
for Diffusion and Diffusion Cloud. These examples can also be used with the Android API.

The examples can be built using Apache Maven.

The Maven POM file is also configured to launch the  PublishingClient
example. To use, edit `PublishingClient.java` to set an appropriate URL for
your Diffusion server or Diffusion Cloud service. Then start the example using Maven:

    `mvn clean compile exec:java`


## Client libraries

The Java client library is available from the [Push Technology Maven repository](https://download.pushtechnology.com/maven/).

You can also download the Java client library from the following locations:

*   Download from [our website](http://download.pushtechnology.com/cloud/latest/sdks.html#java)

*   The client library is also available in the `clients` directory of the Diffusion installation.
